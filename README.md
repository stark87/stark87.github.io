# stark87.github.io
This repo is used to store my projects i want to host on github pages.
The different folders/directories in the root directory of the repo are distinct projects.
The first project "Calculator" is just a number base calclator that coverts numbers from one number base (2, 8, 10, 16) to another.
The second project "Lightbox" is an online gallery that exhibits photos and can be viewed in a lightbox.
